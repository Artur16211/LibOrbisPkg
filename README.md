# LibOrbisPkg

I am developing an open source library for reading and writing PS4 PKG files.
This project's goal is to eliminate the need to use proprietary SDK tools.
Without a proper open PKG tool, the PS4 homebrew scene cannot flourish. 

All code in this repository is licensed under the GNU LGPL version 3, which can be found in LICENSE.txt.

## TODO

- Reverse encryption and signatures
- Create command line tool
- Create GUI tool

## Thanks
