# LibOrbisPkg
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/f0bok1ljnshd2dr0?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maxton/liborbispkg)

I am developing an open source library for reading and writing PS4 PKG files.
This project's goal is to eliminate the need to use proprietary SDK tools.
Without a proper open PKG tool, the PS4 homebrew scene cannot flourish. 

All code in this repository is licensed under the GNU LGPL version 3, which can be found in LICENSE.txt.

## TODO

- Reverse encryption and signatures
- Implement PFS encryption and PKG signing
